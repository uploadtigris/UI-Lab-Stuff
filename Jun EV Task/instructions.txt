It provides the number of EVs in Texas, categorized by ZipCode and merchandise. 
Please organize the data in an Excel sheet, listing the price and types of vehicles. 
Create a new excel sheet. 
Then, categorize the merchandise (which is listed in column in Zip Code sheet) based on whether they are offered as HEV, PHEV, or BEV.
Note that some vehicles might come with multiple options. You are welcome to play around with data to run descriptive analysis too.

Instructions:
- Find prices for the given vehicles (Base, Mid, Upper)/2
- Find options for HEV, PHEV, or BEV

Concerns:
- Prices are variable depending on how new the vehicle is.
    - Some vehicles in the list have been discontinued whilst other ones have brand new version (disproportinately higher prices)
    - Because the registration data was likely captured with most cars of the 2023 year or earliest available price, I did not include 2024 prices.
    - Capturing 2024 prices could present current pricing but likely does not accurately represent consumer car purchase behavior.

- Many options have multiple price tiers, some vehicles have tiers that include a gasoline engine at the higher price point
- or vice versa. Should I create invididual columns for prices of the gasoline + battery options?

- The used car market prices may be considered depending on what the analysis is.
